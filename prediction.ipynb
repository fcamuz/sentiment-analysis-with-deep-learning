It helps us get the local stations and some others in clearly. It’s easy to set up. We are pleased with this purchase.', '🤓We love how easy to install this antenna is!We were able to hide it very nicely behind our real size \"Van Gogh\" 😌We were surprised how even with the antenna working so well even hidden behind the painting , we were afraid of having an ugly black square in the middle of a white wall! 🤪We got many channels without the cable bill😉 , it is great with the sports channels and news ones! the image was really nice and sharp all the time!🤩👍🏻Tip: to know which channels you can get go to \"antenna web dot org\" 😎💃🕺Great, great antenna! the price was more than excellent! Cheers!', 'First of all let me tell you I am mostly a streamer and much prefer the choices and variety of the likes of Netflix, Hulu and the like. I have had been a subscriber of Cable TV services in the past but with the ever increasing pricing In relation to the amount of garbage that’s on regular TV today I made the decision to cut the cord once and for all.What came out of my cord cutting endeavor not only saves me money for stuff I never watch but allows me to invest more of my free time being able to not only watch my local channels for FREE but also gives me the freedom to binge on what I actually like on streaming services without paying hundreds of dollars to make the cable company rich.If you are looking for a good antenna, this one is a good choice. If you want to cut the cord as well just remember that having a TV antenna depends on a factor of things such as distance from the transmitter of the station down to where you live and where you have the antenna placed. Results may vary but mine are very satisfactory.I myself get 33 channels all with good or very good reception. I have my antenna placed behind a picture and it works pretty well. I am not sure about range in comparison to the description but it works well for me. See the video for more information of what to expect but keep in mind that results may vary where you live or have it placed.This antenna DOES seem to work better that others I have tried and it stays out of the way where nobody can see it. Only thing I don’t like about it and would like to see changed in a new version would be to have a white antenna and white wire going down my wall instead of a black wire. It’s not a complete deal breaker and can probably be covered up though.', 'We have a tv we move around for different needs and wanted to be able to use it in the garage to watch sports while still doing projects - this simple and easy to use antenna met our needs perfectly.  I thought I may need my husband to help set it up but it was pretty simple just plug it in, run through the menu options and in under a minute I was able to watch a number of channel easily.', 'Easy to install.  Able to pick up a couple more stations than the one had.  Also gets my local station good.  Picture quality good.  Beats paying high cable fees.'] ['5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5']\n"
